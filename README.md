#kg Kyrgyzstan IT Internships

> A collection of IT internships taking place in Kyrgyzstan.

Highly qualified specialists are always in demand, especially in the IT-sphere. And now, as the software development industry is growing rapidly in Kyrgyzstan it's important to be aware of what opportunities we have.

We do not have many internships here, nevertheless, students and graduates face the problem of not being aware of what internships are happening/will be soon. Let this repository be a little help from me for anyone looking for an internship, cheers ðŸ˜‰
